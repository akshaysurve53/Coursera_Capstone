Thousands of people looses their life in car accidents due to some controllable factors like not paying enough attention during driving, abusing drugs and alcohol or driving at very high speed or some uncontrollable factors like weather, visibility, or road conditions.\nWe are tring to solve this problem by giving warning to driver and remind them to drive carefully in critical situations.
